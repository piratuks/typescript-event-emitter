# typescript-event-emitter
Versatile and feature-rich TypeScript library for event management, providing a solid foundation for building event-driven applications in TypeScript.

# main features

1.  Throttling and Debouncing:
    * flexibility for handling events in scenarios where rapid or frequent triggering needs to be controlled.
2.  Wildcard Listeners:
    * supporting wildcard listeners with the '*' namespace, allowing global event handling.
3.  Namespace Support:
    * namespace support is a great way to organize and manage different types of events within your system.
4.  Priority Queue:
    * prioritizing listeners based on a priority value ensures that critical listeners can be given precedence, offering more control over event execution order.
5.  Event Filtering:
    * the ability to filter events based on registered filters provides a mechanism for selectively emitting events.
6.  Async/Await Pattern:
    * leveraging async/await for asynchronous operations ensures that it can handle asynchronous listeners gracefully.
7.  Global Event Bus Integration:
    * the integration with a global event bus enhances the modularity and usability of event system.
8.  Error Handling:
    * logging errors to the console.
